## Project Description

The Retinopathy Detection and Medical App is a mobile and web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The app provides a user-friendly interface for both patients and healthcare professionals to manage and diagnose retinopathy.

The main objectives of this project include:
- Providing accurate retinopathy diagnosis through advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms.
- Allowing patients to schedule appointments with doctors, view their medical history, and receive personalized health recommendations.
- Enabling healthcare professionals to access patient records, diagnose retinopathy, and provide appropriate treatment plans.
- Facilitating seamless communication between doctors and patients through integrated messaging and video consultation features.
- Ensuring data security and privacy by implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Features

- Retinopathy diagnosis using advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.
- Appointment scheduling for patients with preferred doctors.
- Access to patient records and medical history for healthcare professionals.
- Personalized health recommendations based on diagnosis results.
- In-app messaging and video consultation features for doctor-patient communication.
